# EEG-VR-WWWhich-Task
Materials and code used for a VR-EEG experiment on spatial memory, funded by the Experimental Psychology Society bursary.

The experiment implements the WWWhich task (Davis, Easton, Eacott & Gigg, 2013) of spatial memory using virtual reality and EEG. The intention of the study is to develop a reliable indicator of episodic memory decline in the context of Alzheimer's disease.

EEG analysis will be conducted using Python-MNE.

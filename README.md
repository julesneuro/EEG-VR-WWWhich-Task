# EEG-VR-WWWhich-Task
Materials and code used for a VR-EEG experiment on spatial memory, funded by the Experimental Psychology Society bursary.

The experiment implements the WWWhich task (Davis, Easton, Eacott & Gigg, 2013; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23500896/) of spatial episodic memory using virtual reality and EEG.

**Method:**

In the encoding phase, participants explored x visually distinct environments, differentiated by context and object location. Gaze data was collected from participants throughout their exploration. Find use Unity3D environments in files "...". Find the scripts used to run the eye tracker in files "...".

In the recall phase, participants were shown screenshot images of the virtual environments, varied with correct/incorrect object configuration/contexts. 64-channel EEG was collected throughout recall, time-locked to the stimulus. Find the psychopy stimulus presentations and EEG triggers in files "...".

Participants completed 60 trials x N Stimulus Conditions x N responses = N overall Trials.

Find analysis code for behaviorual data, ERPs, power-band analysis & incorporation of gaze data in files "...".
